# Predicting CO<sub>2</sub> Emissions - ML Project

This project aims to predict CO<sub>2</sub> Emissions from different car models, and predict the safest model in terms of emissions.
The project performs preprocessing, and uses Support Vector Regression, Artificial Neural Network Regression, Random Forest Regression, Elastic Net regression models for predictions.
The models are tuned to for the best results and compared amongst themselves.
For the code, analysis and results, check out the [ipython Notebook](./Team16_Project/Team16_Project.ipynb).
The data used can be found in the [csv file](./Team16_Project/Team16_Carbon_Emissions.csv).
